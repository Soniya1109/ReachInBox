## Project Description

Google Signup Flow:
"I'll click the Google signup button now. After selecting an email, the server generates a JWT token. This token encodes the user's identity and is signed with a secret key to prevent tampering."

Passing JWT Token:
"The JWT token is then appended as a URL parameter, like ?token=your_jwt_token, ensuring that every subsequent request is authenticated. After the token is passed, we land on the main page."

Main Page Overview:
"Here, we have a sidebar with a button for viewing emails. Clicking it fetches data through the API using the JWT for secure access."

Keyboard Shortcuts:
"I’ve also implemented keyboard shortcuts: 'D' opens a confirmation window to delete an email, and 'R' opens a reply window."

Light and Dark Mode Toggle:
"At the top, there's a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes, enhancing user customization."

Conclusion:
"That’s the app—seamless login with JWT security, intuitive email management, efficient shortcuts, and customizable themes."
